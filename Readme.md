## My process

The background images were a struggle. I had trouble figuring out how to position the images and create overflow on the top left and bottom right. I used a flex box, and absolute positioning to put the circles as close to the model position as possible.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

1. You can use <mark> to change the color of just one word inline. Example:
              <mark class="black">Victor Crest</mark>

2. You can add space between words using:
              &nbsp;

3. I learned hwow to correctly put a flexbox within a flex box. I also understand how to make two line lists and justify the space around the items. It made it much easier to do then using padding. 


### Continued development

1. I really want to get a handle of using flexboxes and block elements. Everytime I think I got it, I realize I don't with the next project. 

2. Position items on the screen. I've found makeshift ways, but I don't think it's the cleanest code I can write. I would love to really learn how to position items around on the page. 


### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) - I know that some web devs do not like this site, but I find it useful and easy to locate what I'm looking for. 
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - This forum is the best. So many rich resources and advice here. Literally every question has already been asked.
